# Vendor

The vendor directory is for third-party CSS. 
This is handy when using prepackaged components developed by other people (or for your own components that are maintained in another project). 
jQuery UI and a color picker are examples of CSS that you might want to place in the vendor directory. 
As a general rule you should not modify files in the vendor directory. 
If you need to make modifications, add those after the vendored files are included in the primary stylesheet. 
This will make it easy for update third-party stylesheets to more current versions in the future.
